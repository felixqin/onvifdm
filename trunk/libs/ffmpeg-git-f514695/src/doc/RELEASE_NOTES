General notes
-------------

This release is binary compatible with 0.8. The 'ffmpeg' command-line tool has
been extended to also support the command line syntax and features of a tool
called avconv.

Additionally, this release introduces a number of new interesting codecs
such as the Apple Prores, Flash Screen Video 2 and Windows Media Image,
and muxers such as LATM or CELT in Ogg, among many others. Moreover, our
H.264 decoder has been improved to decode 4:2:2 material and our libx264
wrapper now allows to produce 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 video.
